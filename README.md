# Spirit_Cleaners_Inc
This is my capstone project for SDEV-435-81: Applied Software Practice I at Champlain College.

UPDATE:  A zip folder (Spirit_Cleaners_Inc_v1.1.zip) containing an exe and all files needed to run the game is now included so that anyone can run the game without Python, PyGame or sqlite3 installations.  Extracting the files and running the exe should run  the game.

For testing run Main_Spirit_Cleaners_Inc.py.  
System will need sqlite3 and pygame libraries.  
Development IDE is JetBrains PyCharm.  
File paths are formatted for Windows, Linux run would take modifying slashes.  
Arrow keys for movement, space bar to move to next screen, esc key to exit.  

The project is an arcade style video game called “Spirit Cleaners, Inc”.  The intended design is to get progressively harder and have randomly generated enemy arrangements in levels to keep it interesting and challenging.  The premise is that the player works for a company that specializes in cleaning abandoned haunted properties before new tenants move in.  The player takes control of a remote-controlled vacuum cleaner and must pick up all the trash on the floor of a level.  While picking up trash the player must avoid ghosts and other environmental dangers.  Once all trash has been collected the level moves on to a harder board.  Like any good arcade game, it will feature a leader board that displays the initials, high score, and date of the top 10 scores of all time.  Score will be a combination of number of pieces of debris picked up and how much time is left on a level as a bonus for speed.
